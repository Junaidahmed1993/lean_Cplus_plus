// FUNDAMENTALS OF C++ AND ITS SCRIPT

// 1. Very First Line of Code
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std:: cout << "I like pizza, but burger would be more preffered";
    return 0;
    
}

// Lets try once again
 #Include <iostream>

int main () {
  std:: cout << "Hellowrodl";
  return 0;
}

// We can also use the end line functoion as well but not required or necessary; here is how we can impliment

#include <iostream>
int main () {
  std::cout << "Google world" std::endl;  //So, here we impliment the end line functions.
  return 0;
}

// Suppose, we want to write two lines of code

#include <iostream>
int main () {
  std::cout << "Helloworld" << "\n";
  std::cout << "Great, lets practise C++";
return 0;

// Now, instead of using "ln", we can use endline function like following 
#include <iostream>
int main () {
  std::cout << "Helloworld" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Great to meet you" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
